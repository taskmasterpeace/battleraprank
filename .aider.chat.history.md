Thank you for providing those files. They've given me a better understanding of the application structure. Based on what I've seen so far, here are some additional files that would be helpful to add to get a more complete picture of the application:

1. **Authentication-related files**:
   - `lib/auth-service.ts` or similar (to see how authentication is implemented beyond middleware)
   - `components/auth/AuthProvider.tsx` (if it exists, to understand the auth context)

2. **Core UI components**:
   - `app/layout.tsx` (to understand the overall layout structure)
   - `components/ui/sidebar.tsx` (since it appears to be a key navigation component)

3. **Data management**:
   - `lib/supabase.ts` (to see how Supabase clients are initialized)
   - Any context providers for state management

4. **Key feature components**:
   - A sample page from `/app` directory (to see how the pages are structured)
   - `components/RankingSystem.tsx` (seems to be a core feature)

5. **API routes**:
   - Any key API route handlers in the `/app/api` directory

These files would help me provide a more comprehensive understanding of how the application is structured and how the different parts interact with each other. Let me know if you'd like to add any of these or if there are other specific areas of the application you'd like me to focus on.

   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure Supabase tables match the expected schema
   - Run any necessary migrations

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Page
1. Create a new file in the `/app` directory
2. Use server or client components as needed
3. Add navigation links in relevant places

### Creating a New Component
1. Add the component to `/components`
2. Define proper TypeScript interfaces
3. Use existing UI components where possible

### Adding a New API Endpoint
1. Create a new route handler in `/app/api`
2. Implement the necessary Supabase queries
3. Add proper error handling and validation

### Modifying the Database Schema
1. Update the relevant TypeScript interfaces
2. Modify Supabase tables
3. Update service functions to match new schema
4. Consider migration needs for existing data

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Check Supabase configuration
- Verify OAuth redirect URIs
- Check middleware for correct session handling

### Data Fetching Problems
- Inspect Supabase queries in service files
- Check for permission issues
- Verify data types match expected schema

### UI Rendering Issues
- Check component props
- Verify state management
- Inspect client vs. server component usage

## Code Conventions

### Component Structure
- "use client" directive for client components
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- Consistent use of shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Data Fetching
- Server components for initial data fetching
- Client components for interactive data fetching
- Error handling and loading states

### Authentication
- Role-based access control
- Server-side validation
- Client-side UI adaptation based on roles

## Future Development Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement more aggressive caching
   - Optimize large list rendering

2. **Feature Expansion**:
   - Enhanced analytics dashboard
   - More social features
   - Mobile app integration

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Consider serverless functions for heavy operations
   - Implement CDN for media content

4. **Testing**:
   - Add comprehensive unit tests
   - Implement E2E testing
